2. If none exists, open an issue to discuss your proposal
3. Wait for feedback before starting large changes

### Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork via GitHub UI, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/discord-forum-api.git
cd discord-forum-api
git remote add upstream https://github.com/KevinTrinh1227/discord-forum-api.git
```

## Creating a Pull Request

## PR Checklist

## Common Issues

### Merge Conflicts

```bash
# Sync with upstream
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Rebase your branch
git checkout feat/your-feature
git rebase main

# Resolve conflicts, then
git push --force-with-lease origin feat/your-feature
```

### CI Failures

1. Check the CI logs for the specific failure
2. Run tests locally: `pnpm test`
3. Run linting: `pnpm lint`
4. Fix and push

### Large PRs

Break large changes into smaller, focused PRs:

- Each PR should do one thing
- Easier to review
- Faster to merge
- Lower risk of conflicts

## After Merging

1. Delete your branch (GitHub usually prompts)
2. Sync your fork:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main
   git push origin main
   ```
3. Celebrate your contribution!
