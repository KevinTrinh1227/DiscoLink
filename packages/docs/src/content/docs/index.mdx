  <Card title="Zero Friction Content" icon="pencil">
    Your community creates content naturally in Discord. No extra tools, no learning curve—just conversations that become documentation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Real-time Sync" icon="rocket">
    Messages sync automatically. New threads, edits, reactions—everything appears in your database instantly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Privacy First" icon="approve-check">
    Built-in consent system respects user privacy. Only sync content from users who opt in.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fully Customizable" icon="setting">
    REST API gives you full control. Build any frontend: FAQ pages, blogs, support portals, or custom dashboards.
