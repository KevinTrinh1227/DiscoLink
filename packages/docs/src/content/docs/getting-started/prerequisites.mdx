---

import { Aside, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Before setting up Discord Forum API, make sure you have the following.

## System Requirements

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| **Node.js** | 20.x or later | [Download](https://nodejs.org/) |
| **pnpm** | 9.x or later | [Install guide](https://pnpm.io/installation) |
| **Git** | Any recent version | For cloning the repo |

## Discord Requirements

You'll need a Discord application with a bot. If you don't have one yet, don't worry—we'll walk through creating one in the [Discord Bot Setup](/guides/discord-bot-setup) guide.

### What You'll Need

- **Discord Account** with access to the Developer Portal
- **Discord Server** with at least one forum channel
- **Admin permissions** on the server where you'll add the bot

<Aside type="tip">
  Forum channels require **Community** to be enabled on your Discord server. Go to Server Settings → Community to enable it.
</Aside>

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Node.js 20+ installed (`node --version`)
- [ ] pnpm 9+ installed (`pnpm --version`)
- [ ] Discord account ready
- [ ] Discord server with Community enabled
- [ ] Forum channel created (or will create one)

## Installing Prerequisites

### Node.js

Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). Choose the LTS version.

Verify installation:

```bash
node --version
# v20.x.x or higher
```

### pnpm

Install pnpm globally:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Or use Corepack (included with Node.js 16.13+):

```bash
corepack enable pnpm
```

Verify installation:

```bash
pnpm --version
# 9.x.x or higher
```

## Optional Tools

These aren't required but can be helpful:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Docker** | For containerized deployment |
| **Turso CLI** | For Turso database management |
| **VS Code** | Recommended editor with great TypeScript support |

## Hardware Requirements

Discord Forum API is lightweight:

| Use Case | RAM | Storage |
|----------|-----|---------|
| Development | 512MB | 100MB |
| Small community (under 1000 threads) | 512MB | 500MB |
| Large community (10000+ threads) | 1GB+ | 2GB+ |

<Aside>
  Storage depends on message count and attachment metadata. Actual media files are served from Discord's CDN, not stored locally.
</Aside>
