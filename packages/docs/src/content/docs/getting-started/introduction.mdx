Discord Forum API is an **API-first solution** that transforms your Discord forum channels into a powerful, searchable database with a REST API. Build community FAQs, developer blogs, knowledge bases, and more - all powered by your Discord community.

## How It Works

```
Discord Forum Channel → Bot syncs content → SQLite/Turso DB → REST API → Your App
```

1. **Bot joins your server** and monitors forum channels
2. **Content syncs automatically** to your database (SQLite or Turso)
3. **REST API exposes** threads, messages, users, and search
4. **Build anything**: FAQ pages, blogs, support portals, knowledge bases

## Quick Example

Fetch all threads from a server:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/threads?serverId=123456789
```

Response:

```json
{
  "threads": [
    {
      "id": "123456789",
      "title": "How do I set up authentication?",
      "status": "resolved",
      "messageCount": 12,
      "author": {
        "username": "helpful_user",
        "avatar": "abc123"
      },
      "tags": ["authentication", "solved"]
    }
  ],
  "hasMore": true,
  "nextCursor": "..."
}
```
